# Demo: What If...

Welcome adventurer.

What If ... is a demo game with minimal but non-linear mechanics.

You can start just one main quest but you decide how to do it. 
You can follow the law and make yourself useful to the community, or you can give yourself to theft. You can be smart and try to do both.

What you will see may seem small to you, but it was a great adventure to create it.

The creator, Pasquale Palombo.
